# [Open Verifiable Schema Registry](https://github.com/openverifiable/open-verifiable-types)

## 🌍 Introduction
The **Open Verifiable Schema Registry** is a decentralized repository designed to **aggregate, standardize, and provide access to common schemas used throughout the internet**. It serves as a **hub for openness and verifiable typings**, allowing schemas to be **shared, repurposed, and extended beyond their original intent**. This approach helps **lower the barrier for namespaces to establish themselves in the decentralized internet**, fostering interoperability and trust across Web3 and AI ecosystems.

Built to support **decentralized identity assurance, AI attribution, and open trust standards**, Open Verifiable ensures schemas remain **interoperable, community-driven, and aligned with global verification frameworks**.

## 🎯 Mission Statement
Our mission is to **enable a decentralized, verifiable, and privacy-preserving trust infrastructure** by maintaining a shared repository of schemas for:
- **Identity Verification & Trust Models** (e.g., OpenID IDA, W3C Verifiable Credentials, Cheqd DID-Linked Resources)
- **AI-Generated Content Provenance & Attribution** (e.g., C2PA, W3C Metadata)
- **Reputation & Trust Frameworks** for decentralized applications
- **Governance Models** for digital trust and verification policies

By adopting open schemas, organizations, developers, and individuals can **verify identity, establish content authenticity, and manage trust without reliance on centralized authorities**.

## 🚀 Current Development
At this stage, Open Verifiable is integrating **existing schema standards** from **Verida, Cheqd, OpenID, and W3C** to ensure a strong foundation for trust and verification.

### 🔹 Existing Schemas Referenced
- **Verida Common & Core Repos** – Schema structures for **decentralized identity and storage**
- **Schema-DTS** – A powerful TypeScript toolset that generates TypeScript types from JSON Schemas, allowing developers to work with strongly typed data models that align with schema specifications. Schema-DTS helps ensure **consistency, validation, and interoperability** when integrating schemas into Web3 and decentralized applications.

### 🔹 TypeScript Integration
The repository is designed to **export schema types as a TypeScript package** under:
```bash
@openverifiable/open-verifiable-types
```
This package allows developers to easily import and use **strongly-typed schema definitions** in their applications, ensuring consistency across decentralized identity, content verification, and trust frameworks.

To install the package:
```bash
npm install @openverifiable/open-verifiable-types
```

As we expand, Open Verifiable will introduce **modular, extensible schemas** to support:
- DID-based verification & reputation scoring
- AI-generated content provenance tracking
- OpenID & W3C-aligned credential models

## 📜 Ethos
We believe in:
✅ **Decentralization First** – Trust frameworks should be open, verifiable, and permissionless.  
✅ **Privacy-Preserving Verification** – Users should control how their identity and credentials are shared.  
✅ **Interoperability** – Open Verifiable bridges **Web2 identity models (OpenID, OAuth)** with **Web3 trust networks (DIDs, VCs, Cheqd)**.  
✅ **Community Governance** – Schema evolution should be driven by **decentralized governance** to ensure fairness and transparency.  

## 📌 Next Steps
1️⃣ **Define core schemas** based on Verida, Cheqd, OpenID, and W3C models.  
2️⃣ **Publish an API & repository for schema querying and updates.**  
3️⃣ **Establish a DAO governance model** to maintain schema updates.
