## Context

The Open Verifiable Schema Registry must support global-scale adoption with millions of schemas, thousands of concurrent users, and high-frequency validation requests. Performance and scalability are critical for ecosystem success, user experience, and operational sustainability.

Key performance and scalability requirements include:
- **Global Scale**: Support millions of schemas and users worldwide
- **High Availability**: 99.9% uptime with minimal service disruption
- **Low Latency**: Sub-100ms response times for common operations
- **High Throughput**: Handle thousands of requests per second
- **Efficient Storage**: Optimize storage for large schema volumes
- **Elastic Scaling**: Auto-scale based on demand

## Decision

**Implement comprehensive performance and scalability architecture** with microservices design, intelligent caching, database optimization, and cloud-native auto-scaling to support global ecosystem adoption while maintaining excellent user experience.
