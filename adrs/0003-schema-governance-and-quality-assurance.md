## Context

The Open Verifiable Schema Registry needs a governance model that:

- Enables community-driven schema development and evolution
- Maintains high quality standards for universal schemas
- Prevents vendor lock-in and corporate capture
- Scales with community growth
- Provides clear processes for participation and contribution
- Ensures standards compliance and interoperability

The governance model must balance:
- **Community Participation**: Enable broad participation from diverse stakeholders
- **Quality Control**: Maintain high standards for universal schemas
- **Decision Speed**: Enable timely decisions while ensuring thorough review
- **Transparency**: Provide clear visibility into decision-making processes
- **Sustainability**: Create long-term governance structures
