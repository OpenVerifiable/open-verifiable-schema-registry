## Context

The Open Verifiable Schema Registry operates as a core component within the broader Open Verifiable ecosystem. To ensure consistency, interoperability, and adherence to ecosystem principles, the schema registry must formally align with the ecosystem architecture decision records (ADRs 0001-0039) while maintaining its specific responsibilities as a schema management service.

Key alignment requirements include:
- **Ecosystem Principles**: Full adherence to the 10 foundational principles
- **Technical Standards**: Implementation of ecosystem technical standards
- **Integration Patterns**: Seamless integration with ecosystem components
- **Governance Model**: Participation in ecosystem governance processes
- **Security Framework**: Compliance with ecosystem security requirements

## Decision

**Implement comprehensive ecosystem alignment strategy** that formally establishes the schema registry's role within the Open Verifiable ecosystem while ensuring full compliance with ecosystem standards, principles, and integration patterns.
