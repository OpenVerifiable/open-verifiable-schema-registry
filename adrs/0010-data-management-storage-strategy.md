## Context

The Open Verifiable Schema Registry requires a comprehensive data management and storage strategy that ensures data integrity, supports regulatory compliance, enables efficient operations, and provides robust backup and recovery capabilities. The strategy must handle diverse data types, support global distribution, and maintain strict security and privacy standards.

Key data management requirements include:
- **Data Integrity**: Cryptographic verification and immutable storage
- **Regulatory Compliance**: GDPR, CCPA, and international privacy laws
- **Performance**: Optimized storage for fast retrieval and processing
- **Scalability**: Support for massive schema volumes and global distribution
- **Security**: Encrypted storage with comprehensive access controls
- **Backup & Recovery**: Reliable backup and disaster recovery capabilities

## Decision

**Implement comprehensive data management and storage strategy** with multi-tier storage architecture, cryptographic integrity verification, privacy-preserving design, and robust backup and recovery systems to ensure data sovereignty, security, and operational excellence.
