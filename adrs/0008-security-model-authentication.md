## Context

The Open Verifiable Schema Registry requires a robust security model that protects schema integrity, ensures proper authentication and authorization, and maintains user privacy while enabling ecosystem interoperability. The security model must be built on cryptographic foundations, support DID-based authentication, and provide comprehensive threat protection.

Key security requirements include:
- **DID-Based Authentication**: Cryptographic identity verification using DIDs
- **Role-Based Authorization**: Fine-grained access control for schema operations
- **Schema Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of schema authenticity
- **Threat Protection**: Comprehensive protection against common threats
- **Privacy Preservation**: User privacy protection and GDPR compliance
- **Audit Transparency**: Complete audit trails for security accountability

## Decision

**Implement comprehensive cryptographic security model** based on DID authentication, role-based authorization, and zero-trust architecture principles while maintaining usability and ecosystem interoperability.

### Authentication Architecture

#### DID-Based Authentication System
```typescript
interface DIDAuthentication {
  // Authentication Flow
  authenticationFlow: {
    // Step 1: Challenge Request
    challengeRequest: {
      endpoint: "POST /api/v1/auth/challenge";
      input: {
        did: string;
        requestedScopes: string[];
        clientMetadata?: ClientMetadata;
      };
      output: {
        challenge: string;
        nonce: string;
        expiresAt: number;
        algorithmRequirements: string[];
      };
    };
    
    // Step 2: Challenge Response
    challengeResponse: {
      endpoint: "POST /api/v1/auth/authenticate";
      input: {
        did: string;
        challenge: string;
        signature: string;
        proof: VerifiablePresentation;
        requestedScopes: string[];
      };
      output: {
        accessToken: string;
        refreshToken: string;
        expiresIn: number;
        scope: string[];
        tokenType: "Bearer";
      };
    };
    
    // Step 3: Token Validation
    tokenValidation: {
      process: "Cryptographic signature validation";
      verification: "DID document key verification";
      revocation: "Real-time revocation checking";
      expiration: "Token expiration validation";
